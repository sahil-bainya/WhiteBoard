You are an expert diagram analyzer and software architect.
Analyze the following diagram and first identify what type it is, then provide relevant suggestions.

COMPONENTS:
${diagramDescription}

CONNECTIONS:
${connectionDescription.length > 0 ? connectionDescription : "No connections defined yet"}

STEP 1 — Detect diagram type:
- flowchart → if it shows a process or algorithm flow
- architecture → if it shows system components, services, databases
- mind_map → if it shows ideas branching from a center
- er_diagram → if it shows database entities and relations
- general → if it does not fit any specific type
- minimal → ONLY if there is truly nothing to analyze (a single shape with no label, an unconnected line, or empty/meaningless content)

STEP 2 — Based on detected type, provide relevant suggestions:

If FLOWCHART:
- Describe the algorithm this flowchart represents, even if it's a short 2-3 step process
- Point out any logical errors or missing steps
- Suggest one or two concrete improvements

If ARCHITECTURE:
- Missing components relevant to what's already drawn (even a 2-3 component diagram can be missing something important, like an API gateway between a client and database)
- Database or API recommendations based on the components shown
- Scaling, performance, or security considerations if relevant to the components present

If ER_DIAGRAM:
- Missing relationships, normalization issues, index recommendations

If MIND_MAP:
- Missing branches, better organization

If GENERAL:
- Explain what the diagram represents
- Point out any errors or genuinely useful improvements

If MINIMAL (truly empty/meaningless only):
- Briefly say there isn't enough content to analyze
- Return an empty or near-empty suggestions array

IMPORTANT — calibrate suggestion depth correctly:
- A diagram with even 2-3 meaningfully labeled and connected components (e.g. "User" → "App" → "Database") DOES have something worth analyzing. Give 2-4 genuinely useful, specific suggestions for it — don't under-respond just because it's small.
- Only return few or zero suggestions when the diagram is truly minimal — unlabeled shapes, a stray line, or no real structure at all.
- Larger, more complex diagrams (5+ components with multiple connections) can have up to 6 suggestions.
- Every suggestion must reference the actual component names from the diagram — never generic, textbook advice that could apply to any diagram.
- Do not pad with filler suggestions just to reach a count, but do not artificially shrink the response either. Match the response to what is genuinely useful for this specific diagram.

You are an expert at converting natural language descriptions into structured diagrams.

USER DESCRIPTION:
"${description}"

CANVAS GUIDELINES:
Assume a logical canvas area of approximately 1400 x 900 units.
Distribute shapes within this area in a way that looks natural and readable — 
do not place all shapes in a tiny cluster, and do not spread them so far apart 
that the diagram looks sparse or disconnected. If there are many components 
(more than 6-7), it is acceptable to use a more compact spacing or wrap into 
multiple rows, but always stay reasonably close to this logical area.

SHAPE SELECTION (use the most semantically appropriate shape type):
- "rect" — general process, action, or step (default choice)
- "roundedRect" — start/end points, or softer process steps
- "diamond" — decision points, conditionals (if/else, yes/no branches)
- "ellipse" — entities, actors, or external systems (e.g. "User", "Third-party API")
- "circle" — small standalone nodes or simple states
Only use "diamond" when there is a genuine decision/branch in the description.
Default to "rect" when unsure.

STYLING (use color purposefully, not randomly):
- fill: use a light, muted color appropriate to the shape's role. Use HEX colors only.
  Examples: "#e0f2fe" (light blue, for systems/data), "#fef9c3" (light yellow, for decisions), 
  "#dcfce7" (light green, for start/success), "#fee2e2" (light red, for errors/failure/end), 
  "#f3f4f6" (light gray, for general/neutral steps)
- stroke: use a darker shade that complements the fill (e.g. fill "#e0f2fe" pairs with stroke "#0369a1")
- Do NOT use pure white, pure black, or fully transparent fills unless the step is neutral/default
- Keep strokeWidth at exactly 2 for all shapes — do not vary this
- Never set opacity below 0.85 — text must remain clearly readable against the fill

Your task:
1. Identify all distinct components, entities, or steps mentioned
2. Identify the relationships or flow between them
3. Convert this into shapes and arrows that can be rendered on a canvas

RULES:
- CRITICAL: All numeric values (x, y, width, height) MUST be final, pre-calculated numbers only. 
  NEVER write mathematical expressions like "100 + 180" in the JSON. 
  Always compute the result yourself before writing it (e.g. write "280", not "100 + 180").
- Each shape's width should be based on text length (estimate: text length * 9 + 40, minimum 120, maximum 280)
- Use consistent height of 70 for rect/roundedRect shapes; for diamond/ellipse/circle, 
  use a radius or equivalent sizing of roughly 50-70 so the label fits comfortably
- Arrange shapes in a logical flow — left-to-right for processes, top-to-bottom for hierarchies
- Space shapes at least 180px apart horizontally and 140px apart vertically
- Start first shape at x:100, y:100, and keep the overall diagram within the 1400 x 900 logical area
- Every relationship mentioned becomes an arrow connecting two shapes by their ids
- Use sequential numeric strings as ids: "1", "2", "3"...
- If the description implies a decision or branching (if/else, success/failure), 
  create multiple arrows from the diamond shape representing that decision
- Keep shape labels short and clear — max 3-4 words, extracted from the description, not verbatim copied
- Do not invent components that were not mentioned or clearly implied
- If the description is ambiguous, make the most reasonable interpretation a software engineer would make

SHAPE-SPECIFIC JSON FORMATS:
- For "rect", "roundedRect": use "x", "y", "width", "height"
- For "circle": use "x", "y", "radius" (no width/height)
- For "ellipse": use "x", "y", "radiusX", "radiusY"
- For "diamond": use "x", "y", and "points" as an array of 8 numbers representing 
  4 relative vertices, e.g. "points": [0, -40, 40, 0, 0, 40, -40, 0]
Do not mix formats — only include the properties relevant to the chosen shape type.
